                    One of the basic operations with numbers is their comparison. We suspect that you are fluent in this operation and can compare any numbers, including integers. In this task, you need to compare two integers.

                <p>Everyone knows that "the sum does not change when the terms are rearranged." <br>However, it also happens that permuting two numbers leads to more interesting consequences.

                    Let's say, for example, there are three numbers: a1, a2, a3. Let's consider the equality a1+ a2= a3. It may be false (for example, if a1= 1, a2= 4, a3= 3), but it may become true if you swap some numbers (for example, if you swap a2 and a3, it will become the equality 1 + 3 = 4).

                    Your task is to determine, given the three numbers, whether they can be rearranged so that the sum of the first two is equal to the third.</p>

                <p>Yerassyl Ivanovich came to the market and decided to buy two watermelons: one for himself and one for his mother-in-law. It is clear that he needs to choose a heavier watermelon for himself and a lighter one for his mother-in-law. But here's the problem: there are too many watermelons and he doesn't know how to choose the lightest and the heaviest watermelon? Help him!
